What is the order of growth forisPrimegiven the following order of growths forisDivisible(n,i)?
1.  Time:O(1), SpaceO(1)

Time: O(1) x n
Space: O(1)

Space should be same
Time should be multiplied by n

2.Space doesnot add
O(n)
(b)

1.

Space should be same because iteration changes variable value

Time should be multiplied by sqrt(n)

T(n) = sqrt(n)T(
(c)

You can assume that the order of growth forisDivisible(n,i)isO(1).


Time : isPrime gets called 

??????


(d)

1.	log2(n) = 

2.	Is 2^(2n) = 4^n = O(2^n)?

False
